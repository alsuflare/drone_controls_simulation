Drone Controls - UAV Modeling
Spring 2023

This is a Python-based project focused on modeling 3D motion and controls for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The simulation takes into account air resistance and inertia, ensuring a realistic representation of UAV behavior. This repository serves as a valuable resource for enthusiasts and researchers seeking a deeper understanding of UAV flight dynamics and control. 

The project was done as part of ME457 Drone Controls course at the Cooper Union Institute.
