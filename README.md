Drone Controls - UAV Modeling
Spring 2023

This is a Python-based project focused on modeling 3D motion and controls for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The simulation takes into account air resistance and inertia, ensuring a realistic representation of UAV behavior.

The project was done as part of ME457 Drone Controls course at the Cooper Union Institute.
